# Project Description
This UiPath project has been a highly enjoyable and valuable experience, during which I acquired a set of practical skills that I believe will be useful. The primary objective of this project was to automate a testing process involving the exchange of data between an Excel file and a web-hosted database. The testing procedure consisted of four key steps:

**Create Data:** The automation process is designed to create data within the database. This step evaluates whether data creation is successful.

**Read Data:** After populating the database, the project reads the data to verify that it was successfully recorded.

**Edit Data:** The automation process allows for data editing within the database, and its success is evaluated during this step.

**Delete Data:** In the final step, the project deletes the data from the database and verifies whether the data removal is successful.

# Project Files
In the project folder, you will find the following files and resources:

**Main.xaml:** This is the main automation file that orchestrates the entire testing process.

**Data Folder:** Contains the Excel file with the data to be exchanged and tested.

**Documentation:** A folder with project-related documentation and files.

**Reference List:** This document provides references to resources and materials used during the project's development.

**Diploma Proof:** You will find proof of the completion of an online course (diploma) related to UiPath, which has contributed to my skills and knowledge.

# Conclusion
This UiPath project demonstrates the capabilities of UiPath automation in a real-world scenario, particularly in the context of data exchange between an Excel file and a web-hosted database. The project files and documentation serve as valuable resources for understanding the project's implementation and the references used during its development.
