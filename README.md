# Project Description
This UiPath project has been a highly enjoyable and valuable experience, during which I acquired a set of practical skills that I believe will be useful. The primary objective of this project was to automate a testing process involving the exchange of data between an Excel file and a web-hosted database. The testing procedure consisted of four key steps:

**Create Data:** The automation process is designed to create data within the database. This step evaluates whether data creation is successful.

**Read Data:** After populating the database, the project reads the data to verify that it was successfully recorded.

**Edit Data:** The automation process allows for data editing within the database, and its success is evaluated during this step.

**Delete Data:** In the final step, the project deletes the data from the database and verifies whether the data removal is successful.

# Using the Automation Program
**Getting Started**
1. Launch the Program: When you start the program, you will be prompted to enter the relevant email and password. Please provide the necessary credentials to access the system.

2. Select the Test Type: After entering your credentials, you will have the option to choose what you want to test. You can select from the following test options:

**All**: This option initiates a comprehensive test that covers all aspects of the testing process.

**Orders & OrderDetails:** Selecting this option specifically tests the interactions related to orders and order details.

**Customers:** Choosing this option focuses on testing customer-related interactions.

**Products:** This option is designed to test interactions related to products.

3. Automated Testing: Once you make your choice, the relevant section will be automatically tested by the program. The results of the testing process will be displayed, indicating whether the operation was successful or not. A "TRUE" value will be written back into the Excel file used for testing, signifying a successful test outcome.

# Project Files
In the project folder, you will find the following files and resources:

**Main.xaml:** This is the main automation file that orchestrates the entire testing process.

**Data Folder:** Contains the Excel file with the data to be exchanged and tested.

**Documentation:** A folder with project-related documentation and files.

**Reference List:** This document provides references to resources and materials used during the project's development.

**Diploma Proof:** You will find proof of the completion of an online course (diploma) related to UiPath, which has contributed to my skills and knowledge.

# Conclusion
This UiPath project demonstrates the capabilities of UiPath automation in a real-world scenario, particularly in the context of data exchange between an Excel file and a web-hosted database. The project files and documentation serve as valuable resources for understanding the project's implementation and the references used during its development.
